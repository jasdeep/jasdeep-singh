**Software engineer, film writer and translator**


I spend most of my time solving problems related to performance and security engineering at [basware.com](basware.com). I consumer lot of written word, be it meanderings on science and technology, philosophy, visual or literary arts. I spend less time on writing but when I do, I write dialogues for award winning [Punjabi films](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9359129/), essays on [Punjabi oral tradition](/writing/mirza-pala), [digital literary sphere](https://scroll.in/article/973761/art-sans-borders-how-the-pandemic-has-brought-the-two-punjabs-closer-through-literature) and [artist profiles](https://cafedissensus.com/2017/04/15/a-photographers-world-the-art-of-randeep-maddoke/). In my opinion, translation is close reading of the texts, so I translate literature between [Punjabi and English](https://parchanve.wordpress.com/) languages. I know a bit of Urdu/Shahmukhi as well and I host a weekly reading of sixteenth century Punjabi poet [Madho Lal Shah Hussain](https://sayshussain.wordpress.com/).


I curate [Kirrt project](https://kirrt.org), an online gallery that hosts stories and photographs of Punjabi labourers, artisans and artists and I am a part of the farmers protest newsletter [Trolley Times](https://trolleytimes.com) as well.
