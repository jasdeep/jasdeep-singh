Shabdan de Parchanve was an effort to bring Punjabi language literature online. It started with posting popular poems in 2005. Then it was decided that poems will be in Gurmukhi script and Unicode fonts so that it is easier to read Punjabi on Web. Poems on this blog are a mix of famous and new poets.

In 2018 I started to post stories, essays and interviews.
