### Trolley Times is a newsletter brought out by like minded people – writers, artists, activists in support of the Kisan Morcha. It is not the official mouthpiece of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha.

Over 95,000 trollies are lined up in the crack of winter at Delhi borders, protesting over the farm bills. In this newsletter, we are trying to bring out protesters’ stories to them while they are camped out at Delhi borders. Our intent, without malice and an ulterior motive, is to simply represent peoples’ voices. In order to do so, we are reaching out to different writers and artists to seek their contributions. We are aware that partisan publishing representation can create rifts in the movement. Our team works round the clock to choose write ups that look beyond such differences and commit to the progress of current movement that is exemplary because of the unity of farmers, labourers and other sections.The newsletter is made to clarify the real news in the midst of fake news, printed in Punjabi and Hindi, this four-page humble beginning is written with hope and optimism. On the first page we will have briefs on the direction and the state of the morcha. Rest of the pages will contain writings, pictures and artworks by contributors.

Trolley Times is inspired by the historic mobilisation and able leadership of all the farmers and farmworker organizations. The morcha has provided vigour to the farmers and farmworkers of not only the Punjab-Haryana region but all over India. On the one hand, the organizations have empowered and organized people to create the mass politicalawakening, on the other hand, the leaders of the organizations have pressurised the ruling and opposition political parties to speak the language of people’s welfare. It has brought hope to well wishers of solidarities and welfarist policies all over the world. The organizations’ leadership has worked resolutely to tread the ideological differences between themselves and bring this united movement to a point where its ultimate conclusion is victory.
