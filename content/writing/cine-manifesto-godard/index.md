#### Notes

14/15: British Sounds, Dziga Vertov Group's third film, came out in
1969. The transcript of the film is available
[here](http://www.chtodelat.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=957%3Abritish-sound-transcript-of-the-film-with-ccmments-&catid=213%3A4-28-make-film-politically&Itemid=452&lang=en).

23/24: "Realism doesn't mean showing real things, but showing how
things really are." Godard also quoted this dictum by Brecht in the
scenario of Les Carabiniers (1963).

25: A reference to Vertov's text "Provisional Instructions to Kino-Eye
Groups" (1926).

29: According to Lenin, "dialectics can be defined as the doctrine of
the unity of opposites" (1961).

38: Kiang Tsing (or Jiang Qing) was Mao Zedong's last wife, well known
for her role in the Cultural Revolution (1966--76) and for forming the
political alliance known as the "Gang of Four". During the Cultural
revolution, Joang Qing, who used to be a Shanghai movie star in the
1940s, created the "internal screenings" (or "internal reference
material film") system which allowed for some filmmakers and elite
intellectuals to watch Western films in screenings that were closed to
the general public. Godard pays homage to her in Vent d'Est (1970),
refering to her
